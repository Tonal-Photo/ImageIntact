# ImageIntact Beta Program

Welcome to the ImageIntact beta program! This allows you to test new features and bug fixes before they're released to the general public.

## How it Works

- When we fix bugs or add features, we create beta builds automatically
- Beta builds are fully code-signed and notarized - no security warnings
- You'll get a download link for each beta release
- We collect feedback and fix any issues before the main release

## Getting Beta Releases

### Option 1: GitHub Releases (Recommended)
1. Go to [ImageIntact Releases](https://github.com/Tonal-Photo/ImageIntact/releases)
2. Look for releases marked with "Pre-release" badge
3. Download the `.dmg` file from the latest beta
4. Install like any normal app

### Option 2: Watch Repository
1. Go to the [ImageIntact repository](https://github.com/Tonal-Photo/ImageIntact)
2. Click "Watch" â†’ "Custom" â†’ Check "Releases"
3. You'll get email notifications for new beta releases
