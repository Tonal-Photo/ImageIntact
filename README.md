## Features

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety First
- **Never deletes files** - Mismatched files are quarantined, not deleted
- **Source protection** - Prevents accidentally using a source folder as a destination
- **Checksum verification** - Every file is verified using SHA-256
- **Detailed logging** - Complete audit trail of all operations

### üöÄ Performance
- **Smart concurrency** - Full speed for local drives, throttled for network volumes
- **Skip identical files** - Only copies what's needed
- **Progress tracking** - See exactly what's being copied in real-time

### üìä Professional Features
- **Multiple destinations** - Back up to up to 4 locations simultaneously
- **Session tracking** - Each backup run has a unique ID for correlation
- **Checksum manifests** - Proof of successful backups for each destination
- **Modified file detection** - Catches files that changed but kept the same size

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/kmichels/ImageIntact/releases) page
2. Open the DMG and drag ImageIntact to your Applications folder
3. On first launch, macOS will ask for permission to access folders - approve this

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Select Source Folder** - The folder containing your original images
2. **Select Destination(s)** - Where you want your backups (external drives, NAS, etc.)
3. **Click Run Backup** - ImageIntact will copy and verify all files

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `‚åòR` - Run Backup
- `‚åò1` - Select Source Folder
- `‚åò2` - Select First Destination
- `‚åò+` - Add Another Destination
- `‚åòK` - Clear All Selections

### Understanding the Status

- ‚úÖ **Green checkmarks** - Files successfully copied or already exist with matching checksums
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warnings** - Files that exist but have different content (will be quarantined)
- ‚ùå **Errors** - Files that couldn't be copied (check logs for details)

## Safety Features

### Quarantine System
When ImageIntact finds a file at the destination that differs from the source, it doesn't delete it. Instead, it:
1. Moves the existing file to `.ImageIntactQuarantine` with a timestamp
2. Copies the new version from the source
3. Logs the action for your review

### Source Folder Protection
Each source folder is tagged with a hidden `.imageintact_source` file. If you try to select a tagged folder as a destination, ImageIntact will warn you and prevent the selection.

## Logs and Verification

### Log Files
Located in each destination at `.imageintact_logs/`:
- Daily CSV files with all operations
- Includes timestamps, file paths, checksums, and action reasons

### Checksum Manifests
Located in each destination at `.imageintact_checksums/`:
- One manifest per backup session
- Contains all successfully backed up files with their checksums
- Can be used to verify file integrity later

To view hidden folders in Finder, press `Cmd + Shift + .`

## Network Drive Support

ImageIntact automatically detects network volumes (SMB, AFP, NFS) and adjusts its behavior:
- Limits concurrent operations to prevent connection drops
- Implements retry logic for checksum verification
- Maintains stability over high-speed connections

## Building from Source

Requirements:
- Xcode 15 or later
- macOS 13 or later

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ImageIntact.git
cd ImageIntact
open ImageIntact.xcodeproj
```

Build and run with `Cmd + R`

## Testing

Run the test suite with `Cmd + U` in Xcode. Tests cover:
- Bookmark persistence
- File quarantine
- Checksum calculation
- Source folder tagging
- Network volume detection

**Remember**: A file doesn't exist unless it exists in three places. ImageIntact helps you get there safely.
