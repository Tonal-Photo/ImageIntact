Version 2.0.0 - Smart Image Search & Intelligent Backup

MAJOR NEW FEATURES (Apple Silicon Macs):

🤖 AUTOMATIC IMAGE ANALYSIS (FREE!)
Your backups just got smarter. While copying files, ImageIntact automatically catalogs what's in each photo - people, places, objects, colors, even text. All processing happens privately on your Mac using Apple's advanced frameworks. This analysis is completely FREE for all users.

🔍 SMART IMAGE SEARCH (Pro Feature)
Unlock the power of your analyzed photos! Search "sunset beach," "birthday party," or "wedding photos" and instantly see results. Uses macOS Tahoe's latest AI technology to understand what you're looking for - no complicated keywords needed. Upgrade to Pro ($4.99 one-time) to unlock Smart Search.

📋 BROWSE YOUR PHOTOS (Pro Feature)
Explore your backed-up images by category: outdoor scenes, people, objects, or colors. Click any category to see matching photos. Perfect for finding "all my beach photos" or "photos with text." Requires Pro upgrade.

💾 NEVER LOSE TRACK OF DRIVES (FREE!)
Know exactly which backup drive contains which photos. Drive tracking is free; Pro unlocks Smart Search to find images on disconnected drives.

⏰ TIMESTAMP ORGANIZATION
New checkbox automatically names backup folders with dates and times (like "2025-10-23_14-05"). Perfect for keeping card imports organized chronologically.

TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS:

• Built with macOS Tahoe's latest frameworks for optimal performance
• Enhanced stability with modern concurrency
• Ready for next-generation Apple Silicon processors
• Faster, more reliable on all supported Macs

WHO GETS WHAT:

FREE FOR ALL Apple Silicon Macs (M1 and newer): Automatic image analysis, drive tracking, and all core backup features. macOS Tahoe recommended for best results.

PRO UPGRADE ($4.99 one-time): Unlocks Smart Search and Browse Mode to search and explore your analyzed photos.

Intel Macs: Get all core backup features - parallel backup, verification, timestamp organization, and detailed logging. AI features require Apple Silicon.

PRIVACY FIRST:

All image analysis happens on your Mac. Nothing is sent to the cloud. Face detection counts people but doesn't identify them. Your photos, your privacy.
