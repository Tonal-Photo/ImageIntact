Version 2.0.0 - Smart Image Search & Intelligent Backup

MAJOR NEW FEATURES (Apple Silicon Macs):

üîç SMART IMAGE SEARCH
Finally! Find any photo using everyday language. Search "sunset beach," "birthday party," or "wedding photos" and instantly see results. Uses macOS Tahoe's latest AI technology to understand what you're looking for - no complicated keywords needed.

ü§ñ AUTOMATIC IMAGE ANALYSIS
Your backups just got smarter. While copying files, ImageIntact automatically catalogs what's in each photo - people, places, objects, colors, even text. All processing happens privately on your Mac using Apple's advanced frameworks.

üìã BROWSE YOUR PHOTOS
Explore your backed-up images by category: outdoor scenes, people, objects, or colors. Click any category to see matching photos. Perfect for finding "all my beach photos" or "photos with text."

üíæ NEVER LOSE TRACK OF DRIVES
Know exactly which backup drive contains which photos. When a drive is unplugged, Smart Search shows you which images are on it and which drive to reconnect.

‚è∞ TIMESTAMP ORGANIZATION
New checkbox automatically names backup folders with dates and times (like "2025-10-23_14-05"). Perfect for keeping card imports organized chronologically.

TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS:

‚Ä¢ Built with macOS Tahoe's latest frameworks for optimal performance
‚Ä¢ Enhanced stability with modern concurrency
‚Ä¢ Ready for next-generation Apple Silicon processors
‚Ä¢ Faster, more reliable on all supported Macs

Apple Silicon Macs (M1 and newer): Get Smart Search, automatic image analysis, and all core backup features. macOS Tahoe recommended for best results.

PRIVACY FIRST:

All image analysis happens on your Mac. Nothing is sent to the cloud. Face detection counts people but doesn't identify them. Your photos, your privacy.
