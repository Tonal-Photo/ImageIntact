ImageIntact - Professional Photo Backup for Mac

Designed by photographers, for photographers. ImageIntact ensures your precious photos and videos are safely backed up to multiple destinations simultaneously, with verification that every file is intact.

NEW IN VERSION 2.0: INTELLIGENT BACKUPS FOR EVERYONE

Your backups just got smarter! ImageIntact now automatically analyzes your photos - FREE for all Apple Silicon Mac users. Objects, scenes, faces, colors - all cataloged privately on your Mac. Upgrade to Pro ($4.99 one-time) to unlock Smart Search and find any photo using everyday language like "sunset beach" or "birthday party."

KEY FEATURES:

• INTELLIGENT ANALYSIS (Apple Silicon Macs) **FREE**
While backing up, ImageIntact automatically catalogs what's in your images. People, places, objects, text - all indexed privately on your Mac. Completely free for all users.

• SMART IMAGE SEARCH (Apple Silicon Macs) **Pro - $4.99**
Find any photo using natural language. Search "wedding photos with cake" or "dogs playing outdoors" and instantly see results. Browse by scenes, objects, or colors. Works even when backup drives are disconnected - you'll know exactly which drive to plug in.

• PARALLEL BACKUP
Back up to multiple destinations at once - each runs at full speed independently. No more waiting for one slow drive to finish.

• VERIFIED INTEGRITY
Every file is verified with checksums. Know with certainty that your backups are perfect copies. Live verification status shows progress in real-time.

• SMART PERFORMANCE
Adaptive threading automatically optimizes for each destination's speed. Network drives, SSDs, and HDDs all run at their best. Accurate time estimates help you plan your workflow.

• REAL-TIME PROGRESS
See exactly what's happening with per-destination progress bars, accurate ETAs, and transfer speeds. Know your data size upfront and when each backup will complete.

• TIMESTAMP ORGANIZATION
Automatically name backup folders with dates and times. Perfect for organizing card imports chronologically.

• PHOTOGRAPHER-FOCUSED
Supports all major RAW formats, DNGs, JPEGs, HEICs, and professional video formats. Handles Lightroom catalogs and Capture One sessions intelligently.

• SAFETY FIRST
Source folders are protected with tags to prevent accidental use as destinations. Duplicate destination prevention ensures no conflicts. Files are quarantined, never deleted.

• DETAILED LOGGING
CSV logs document every operation for your records. Perfect for professional workflows that require audit trails.
