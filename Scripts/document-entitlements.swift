## App Store Submission Notes

When submitting to the App Store, the following entitlements require explanation in the "App Sandbox Information" section:

1. `com.apple.security.files.downloads.read-write`
2. `com.apple.security.assets.pictures.read-write`

### Suggested App Sandbox Information Text:

```
ImageIntact requires the following sandbox entitlements to function as a photo backup application:

‚Ä¢ com.apple.security.files.downloads.read-write
Required to write backup files to user-selected external drives and network volumes, which are commonly mounted outside the standard sandbox. Users explicitly select these destinations through NSOpenPanel.

‚Ä¢ com.apple.security.assets.pictures.read-write
Required to read photo and video files from the user's Pictures folder and Photos library for backup. Users explicitly select source folders through NSOpenPanel.

All file access is initiated by explicit user selection through the standard macOS file picker. The app never accesses files without user permission.
```
